                <p>The provincial capital of Prachuap Khiri Khan is a fishing port with a superb location beside beautiful curving bays and amongst steep mountain outcrops. About 100 kilometres to the north of Prachuap Khiri Khan is Hua Hin, Thailand’s first
                    beach resort, which is renowned for world-class golf and spa resorts. Between Hua Hin and Prachuap Khiri Khan are Pran Buri, where there are many boutique resorts, and Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, which features soaring peaks, numerous
                    caves and exotic bird lives.</p>

                <p>The well-known event of the province is paying homage to Buddha's relics in Khao Chong Krajok. The event is held every 12th of June. People will pay homage to Lord Buddha's relics and enclose the pagoda with cloth. Moreover, they can see
                    Prachuap Bay's view from the mountain in the city's centre.Although the province beyond Hua Hin is not a major tourist spot, it is certainly rich in natural resources, including mountainous areas, islands, and relaxing beaches. The
                    province also features several national parks, including Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park which was established to protect the largest freshwater marshes in Thailand.</p>

            <div class="flex-columns">
                <p> - Hua Hin Beach is located in Hua Hin District, Prachuap Khiri Khan Province. It is one of the most popular beaches in Thailand. It was a villa for the royal family in the past with a long history from the reign of King Rama III. Hua Hin
                    Beach area starts from the Hua Hin Tunnel to Khao Takiab Mountain, a distance of about 13 kilometers. Hua Hin is a clean beach with fine sand and clear water, suitable for swimming. When compared from Bankok to Prachuap Khiri Khan
                    Province, Hua Hin is the most beautiful beach among them all.</p>
                <p> - Hidden deep inside a cave near the seaside resort of Hua Hin in rural southern Thailand, there is a fantastic sight. The magnificent gold and green Kukha Karuhas pavilion, the smallest temple in Thailand, is a religious landmark in the
                    Phraya Nakhon Cave, one of Thailand's most beautiful and most photographed caves. The giant limestone cave is a popular tourist attraction with trees reaching for its rooftop openings. However, its remote location makes it challenging
                    to get to and limits the number of visitors who can catch a glimpse of this stunning sight. The cave’s tranquil atmosphere consists of two chambers, each with a rooftop opening that allows the sun to shine through. The in-flowing sunlight
                    contrasts with the cave's darkness to create a mystical sensation. A forest growing within the cave makes it a bright and colourful natural attraction.</p>
                <p> - Pak Nam Pran is situated at Tambon Pak Nam Pran at the mouth of the Pran River. Pak Nam Pran is aspot where the river runs into the sea. Most of the local people are fishermen; therefore, this village is a marketplace of low-priced seafood.
